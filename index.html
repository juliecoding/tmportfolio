              Since Fall 2022, I've been a technical instructor for Tech-Moms, a
              non-profit organization that teaches women basic coding and
              exposes them to the many kinds of job opportunities in tech.
              Hundreds of women have come through the program and have improved
              their tech skills and career prospects. The courses are not
              designed to be a bootcamp, but rather a career exploration program
              with a coding component.

              Teaching the class is one of the most meaningful parts of my week.
              My favorite part is watching my students gain greater confidence
              and discover that they can "do" tech. It's not an unapproachable,
              incomprehensible discipline; it's a dynamic part of today's world,
              one they can thrive in.

            I'm a full-stack Senior Software Engineer at Splice, whose library
            of royalty-free samples is used by top music producers to write
            songs. We work in Go, MySQL, GraphQL, and Javascript. Our
            infrastructure runs on Amazon Web Services. My projects have
            involved asset ingestion, decomposition, and downloads. Splice is an
            awesome place to work because the business-to-consumer model makes
            me feel like I'm making a difference in software that means a lot to
            people. I love that we further producers' artistic endeavors and
            fuel their creativity.

            I moved from studying the humanities to learning tech. This varied
            background has been a real asset in my work. Studying languages and
            literature helped me gain communication skills, while software
            development satisfies the part of my mind that enjoys puzzles,
            system design, and problem-solving.
